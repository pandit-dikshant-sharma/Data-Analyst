🐍 INTRODUCTION TO PYTHON FOR DATA ANALYSIS
===============================================

Welcome to the "Introduction to Python" section — a beginner-friendly, hands-on learning space designed for future data analysts.

Whether you're starting from zero or brushing up on the basics, this folder will guide you through the essential building blocks of Python you'll need before moving into real-world data projects.

------------------------------------------------
📚 WHAT YOU'LL LEARN
------------------------------------------------

✔️ Basic Python syntax and indentation  
✔️ Variables, data types, and type conversion  
✔️ Arithmetic and logical operators  
✔️ Control flow (if, elif, else)  
✔️ Functions and reusability  
✔️ Lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets  
✔️ Loops and iterations (for, while)  
✔️ Practice problems to test your understanding

------------------------------------------------
📁 FILES IN THIS FOLDER

------------------------------------------------
🎯 WHO THIS IS FOR
------------------------------------------------

- Beginners just starting their journey in data analysis  
- Students looking for structured Python learning  
- Self-learners and career switchers building core skills

------------------------------------------------
💡 TIPS FOR GETTING THE MOST OUT OF THIS
------------------------------------------------

- Don’t just read the code — run it and experiment!  
- Make mistakes, fix them, and learn by doing.  
- Use this as your foundation before jumping into Pandas, NumPy, or real-world datasets.  
- Revisit the notebooks as many times as needed — repetition builds confidence.
