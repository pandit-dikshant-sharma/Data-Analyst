# 🐍 Introduction to Python for Data Analysis

Welcome to the **"Introduction to Python"** section — a beginner-friendly, hands-on learning space designed for future data analysts.

Whether you're starting from zero or brushing up on the basics, this folder will guide you through the essential building blocks of Python you'll need before moving into real-world data projects.

---

## 📚 What You'll Learn

✔️ Basic Python syntax and indentation  
✔️ Variables, data types, and type conversion  
✔️ Arithmetic and logical operators  
✔️ Control flow (`if`, `elif`, `else`)  
✔️ Functions and reusability  
✔️ Lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets  
✔️ Loops and iterations (`for`, `while`)  
✔️ Practice problems to test your understanding

## 💡 Tips for Getting the Most Out of This

- Don’t just read the code — **run it and experiment!**  
- Make mistakes, fix them, and **learn by doing**  
- Use this as your foundation before jumping into **Pandas**, **NumPy**, or real-world datasets  
- Revisit the notebooks as many times as needed — **repetition builds confidence**
