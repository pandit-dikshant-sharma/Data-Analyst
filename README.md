## 🙋‍♂️ About Me

Hey! I’m **Dikshant Sharma**, a Data Analyst with a passion for working with data and solving real-world problems through analytics. I'm currently pursuing my **Master of Computer Applications (MCA)** and constantly working on improving my technical and analytical skills.

Right now, I spend most of my time analyzing data, building visualizations, and extracting insights to help make better decisions. I enjoy simplifying complex concepts and making data more understandable and useful — whether through dashboards, reports, or clean, well-documented code.

While I’m focused on analytics today, my **long-term goal is to become a Data Engineer** — someone who builds the data pipelines, systems, and infrastructure that power analytics and machine learning. I’m currently exploring tools and technologies like **SQL, Python, cloud platforms, and data architecture** to help me get there.

## 🧰 Tools I Will Use

Here are some of the tools and skills you’ll see throughout the projects:

- **Languages & Libraries**:  
  Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn),  
  SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL)

- **Data Visualization & BI Tools**:  
  Power BI, Excel

- **Other Skills**:  
  Data cleaning, EDA, hypothesis testing, regression, clustering, and building simple predictive models

## 🌍 Why I Made This Repository

This repository is built for the **Data Analyst community** — especially for students, self-learners, and early professionals who want to **practice, build, and grow** in this field.

When I first started, I realized that finding clean, beginner-focused, and practical resources wasn’t always easy. A lot of tutorials were either too advanced, too theoretical, or scattered across the internet.

So I decided to create this **open-source learning hub** to bring everything together in one place.

### Here’s what you’ll find in this repo:

- ✅ Hands-on projects with real datasets and guided solutions  
- 📊 Data cleaning & EDA tutorials using Python & SQL  
- 📌 Case studies to help you think like a business analyst  
- 📋 Interview practice questions (with answers and explanations)  
- 📈 Dashboard templates in Excel, Power BI, and Tableau

This repo is meant to be a resource you can **keep coming back to**, whether you're just getting started or brushing up your skills.

If this helps even one person feel more confident in their data journey, I’ll consider it a win.

Feel free to explore, contribute, fork, or just say hi. Let’s grow together as a data community! 🚀

## 🧠 Why I Made This

When I first started learning data analysis, I realized that finding **beginner-friendly, practical, and well-organized resources** wasn’t easy. Most tutorials were either too advanced, too theoretical, or scattered all over the internet with no clear path to follow.

I often wished there was a single place where someone could pick a dataset, follow a project, and actually learn how things work — step by step.

**That’s why I created this repository.**

This repo is not just for me — it’s for **anyone who wants to learn data analysis the practical way**. Whether you're a student, a self-learner, or someone switching careers, this is meant to be a resource you can use to **practice real projects, understand real business problems, and build real skills.**

### My goals with this repo:

- Help beginners get started without feeling overwhelmed  
- Share real-world style projects with clean, explainable code  
- Provide templates, case studies, and challenges you can learn from  
- Build a small, helpful space for the Data Analyst community to grow

While my personal goal is to eventually become a **Data Engineer**, I know how important strong analytical thinking and hands-on analysis experience is — not just for analysts, but for anyone working with data. This repo is my **contribution to the community** that helped me grow, and I hope it helps you too.

Let’s keep learning, building, and supporting each other. 🚀
